# The rdfpub Logo

An open book with RDF at its core. This logo represents the very essence of
rdfpub, a technology that promotes RDF as a first-class citizen on the web.

The logo is made available as an XCF file which is compatible with many popular
image programs such as GIMP or Photoshop. You can also find ready-to-use PNG
versions of the images in
[the rdfpub logo releases](https://github.com/rdfpub/logo/releases).

# Credits

The elements that comprise the rdfpub logo are based on two primary components:
[the W3C RDF icon](https://www.w3.org/RDF/icons/) and
[the 'Book Open' icon at Flaticons.net](https://flaticons.net/customize.php?dir=Miscellaneous&icon=Book-Open.png).
The image was created using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

## The W3C RDF icon

A recolored silhouette of the W3C's RDF icon is used as the centerpiece of the
rdfpub logo. The original icon was created by Bill Schwappacher who donated it
to the W3C "to help coalesce the RDF community and promote the Semantic Web".
The icon has long been used across the web as a symbol for RDF. rdfpub is proud
to embrace the icon and its legacy.

Note that the use of this icon does not imply endorsement of rdfpub by the W3C.
Use of the icon is intended only to establish that rdfpub makes use of RDF.

## Flaticons.net

[Flaticons.net](https://flaticons.net) publishes a collection of customizable
"royalty free flaticons for your personal and commercial web projects". Their
"Book Open" icon serves as the basis for the book graphic of the rdfpub logo.
